## Fundamental Project

## Brief

#### What was required
For this project, the goal that was asked of me was to be able to create an application that has the ability to utilise CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete). I would achieve this using the tools and knowledge gained in the previous training modules covered in the weeks prior to this. I was given some objectives to meet in terms of certain aspects that were required, for example:
* A Trello board with full expansion
on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
* A relational database used to store data persistently for the
project
* Documentation from a design phase describing the application architecture
and a detailed Risk Assessment
* A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best
practices and design principles
* Fully designed test suites for the application, as
well as automated tests for validation of the application
* A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask
* Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the
Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI
server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine

#### My Approach
To hit these requirements, as well as creating something I would take an interest into, I decided to create a very basic Fantasy Football application that would allow the user to do the following:
* Create their own team including:
  * The Team Name
  * Owner Name
  
  So that they may create the team name they like and then also track it with their name being associated to their team. As well as this they will be able to:
  
* Add players into their team by adding in:
  * The Player's name
  * The real team that the player plays for
